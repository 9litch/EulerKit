#Solving Project Euler problems in Swift. Slowly.

###Notes:

* Adding [kicker](https://github.com/alloy/kicker) to see if I can get auto-commit setup.
* Last updated for Xcode6 GM. Will almost certainly not work on any version before Beta 5.
* I dropped the Makefile in favor of a proper xcode project. This way I can write unit and performance tests, which make it a lot easier.
