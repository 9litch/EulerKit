#Solving Project Euler problems in Swift. Slowly.

EulerKit is a small project for learning swift by using [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) problems. I've created the empty problems here and some helper methods to get you moving in the right direction.

###Notes:

* Last updated for Xcode7b4. Will certainly not work on anything before Xcode 7.
