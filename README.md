#Solving Project Euler problems in Swift. Slowly.

###Notes:

* Added [`gitwatch.sh`](https://github.com/nevik/gitwatch) to auto-commit file changes as I make them. This could result in (a) something interesting or, (b) a lot of noise.
* Last updated for Xcode6 GM. Will almost certainly not work on any version before Beta 5.
* I dropped the Makefile in favor of a proper xcode project. This way I can write unit and performance tests, which make it a lot easier.
